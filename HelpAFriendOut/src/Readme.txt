This is easy to demonstrate.
In a publication of New Scientist you could randomise all the letters , keeping the first two and last two the same , and readability would hardly be affected.
My analysis did not come to much because the theory at the time was for shape and sequence recognition.
Saberi’s work suggests we may have some powerful parallel processors at work.
The reason for this is surely that identifying content by parallel processing speeds up recognition.
We only need the first and last two letters to spot changes in meaning .
